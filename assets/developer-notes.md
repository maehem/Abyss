Developer Notes


This game is wholly inspired by the original PC DOS game "Neuromancer" by 
Interplay as well as the book it's based on by William Gibson and all the tropes 
that go with it, let's call it a "Genre".

Many of the elements in this game, story, user interface and game play are very
much similar to the original game.  I'm not trying to reinvent those aspects.

This project is intended to be "Tropy" and nostalgiac while striving to recreate 
much of the experience of the original game play.  That said, as the author of 
the game, I have some of my own ideas to insert and you'll find those quietly 
tucked in here and there.

The story of Jack attempts to stand on it's own while retaining the flavor of
the original game.   The cyberpunk trappings are all the same but Jack's
situation is different.   

At the start of the game Jack wakes up in the hospital.  He has no memory of
who he is.  Jack is informed that he had flatlined(died) while in cyberspace
and only saved by the grace of his neighbor who noticed the door to his
apartment was open a little and saw him there.

Jack is let go out of the hospital.  He has nothing on him except $32 and a few
items.  His wallet has an address, proabably his apartment.  He decides to go
there.   The apartment still has crime scene tape and is locked.  Maybe if
he can log in to the apartment computer site using a terminal?

Once in to the apartment, Jack sees that all his gear is missing.  He goes
to the police who claim not to have it.   He talks to the neighbor who found
him and finds out someone other than the police had been there.  Jack hacks
into the apartment video system and sees this other person. Their distinct
features helps Jack track them down.

Jack finds his gear for sale at a surplus store.  He is able to buy some of it
back but the expensive stuff will have to be reaquired some other way(hacking,organ sales).
